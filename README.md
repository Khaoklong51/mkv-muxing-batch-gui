## 📝Notes

> [!NOTE]
>1. Leaving destination folder empty will lead to overwrite source videos a popup will shown to confirm this action.
>2. When the option [make this subtitle/audio default] is activated with language/track that does not exist in the source, then the option will be ignored.
>3. When the option [keep this subtitle/audio only] is activated with language/track that does not exist in the source video, then the option will lead to output video with only chosen language/track (even if it means to discard all subtitle/audio from the source).
>4. When using `Modify Old Tracks` in video tab, the following options: (make this subtitle/audio default, keep this subtitle/audio only, mux new subtitle/audio in desired position) will be **disabled/limited**.
>5. When using `mux subtitle/audio` at same position for the same track type, they will be added respecting to the order of all other new subtitles/audio.
>6. In every tab/dialog you can reorder tracks using shortcuts `Ctrl + Up Arrow / Ctrl + Down Arrow` except for: (Attachment/Muxing Tab).

## ⬇Downloads

The MKV Muxing Batch GUI is compatible with Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11 32-bit/64-bit and most Linux distributions. 
You can download it from the project's [releases&nbsp;page](https://github.com/yaser01/mkv-muxing-batch-gui/releases).


### For Linux Users
The deployed app available in downloads only support glibc 2.35 and above like: Ubuntu 22.04/up , Mint 21.2/up, Fedora 38/up and others [i can't test them all]
Before starting the app, install the following libraries [not always needed as most of them included in the app]:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libpugixml-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libmatroska-dev
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0
```
### Using Python Code Version

1. Clone the repository :`git clone https://github.com/yaser01/mkv-muxing-batch-gui.git`.
2. The main branch use ``PySide6`` library on version `6.6.1` which is tested on `python 3.10.8` working good and only supporting x64 systems.
3. If you want to use on x32 systems you should switch to branch `develop-PySide2`: `git checkout develop-pyside2` which uses `PySide2 v5.14.0` and tested in `python 3.8.10`.
4. After selecting the branch just make sure to use the mentioned python version as it's guaranteed to work perfect.
5. Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Then run `python main.py` and you are all good :D.
7. You may use `python3/pip3` instead of `python/pip` depending on your system.
8. For linux users if you want to use another python version from the one that is already on your system it's recommended to use `pyenv`,if you didn't hear about it, you may read [this](https://askubuntu.com/a/1195153).
9. Also, for linux users: as this app depends on mkvtoolnix it's very recommended to install it on your system before run the app from [here](https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html).

### Updating The MKVmerge version
You can manually update the mkvmerge version the app uses, but do this only if you're sure of what you're doing, as it may require a reinstallation:
```bash
# Navigate to the app's installation directory, e.g. on Windows:
"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MKV Muxing Batch GUI"
# Go to Resources\\Tools\\ [your operating system], and replace mkvmerge.exe and mkvpropedit.exe with the newer version you have
```

> For linux users it's recommended to just clear `Resources\\Tools\\ [your operating system]` folder and then install mkvtoolnix on your system from [here](https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html) and the app will automatically detect it.

## 🙏Attribution
- The application relies heavily on [MKVToolNix](https://gitlab.com/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix), so a big thanks to them.
- Thanks to my friends who helped test the app and offered numerous ideas.
