## üìùNotes
>**Note**

>1. The video destination folder shouldn't be the same as source folder
>1. When the option [make this subtitle/audio default] is activated with language/track that does not exists in the source, then the option will be ignored
>1. When the option [keep this subtitle/audio only] is activated with language/track that does not exist in the source video, then the option will lead to output video with only chosen language/track (even if it means to discard all subtitle/audio from the source)

## ‚¨áDownloads

The MKV Muxing Batch GUI is compatible with Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11 32-bit/64-bit and most Linux distributions. 
You can download it from the project's [releases&nbsp;page](https://github.com/yaser01/mkv-muxing-batch-gui/releases).

### For Linux Users
Before starting the app, install the following libraries:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libpugixml-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libmatroska-dev
```

### Updating The MKVmerge version
You can manually update the mkvmerge version the app uses, but do this only if you're sure of what you're doing, as it may require a reinstall:
```bash
# Navigate to the app's installation directory, e.g. on Windows:
"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MKV Muxing Batch GUI"
# Go to Resources\\Tools\\ [your operating system], and replace mkvmerge.exe and mkvpropedit.exe with the newer version you have
```

## üôèAttribution
- The application relies heavily on [MKVToolNix](https://gitlab.com/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix), so a big thanks to them.
- Thanks to my friends who helped test the app and offered numerous ideas.
